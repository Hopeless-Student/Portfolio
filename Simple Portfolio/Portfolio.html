        <p>Hello everyone! <b>I am 1st year College</b> Student from University of Caloocan City, taking <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</b>. Currently I don't know what I want on this journey but I aim to learn more about this field. Im not that good with designs or front-end and it's one of my weaknesses, as you can see to this simple Portfolio. As for my backend skills, it's one of my interest that I want to focus more. Last semester, I learned 1 proramming language which is <b>"C"</b>, I get the fundamentals to a certain level and made 1 project for a case study with my classmate. It's a BINGO game but way more basic because of my knowledge and capability of our IDE(Turbo C++). The day I wrote this, I'm currently learning Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript! That's all, Thanks!
